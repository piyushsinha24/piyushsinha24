# Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹

I'm pursuing a B.tech degree in the field of Computer Science & Engineering as well as self-taught concepts in Mobile & Web development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs. When I'm not coding, tweeting or pushing pixels, you'll find me traveling.
